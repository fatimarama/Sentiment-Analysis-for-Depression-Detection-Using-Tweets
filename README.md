# Project Description:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis to identify signs of depression in social media users based on their tweets. By using multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to detect depression-related sentiments.

## Key Components:
### 1. Data Source:
  - **Source:** Tweets dataset downnloaded from Kaggle.
  - **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing tweets to remove noise such as hashtags, links, and special characters.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Models:

  - **Model Selection:** Used four different models for sentiment analysis to compare results.
  - **Depression Detection:** Models specifically trained to identify depressive sentiments based on the text of the tweets.

## Workflow:
### Data Preparation:
  - Clean and preprocess the text data to ensure it is suitable for analysis, used lowercasing and regex to remove url links and special characters.
  - Used TF-IDF vectorizer to preprocess the text.

### Model Training:
  - Used four different models (LOgistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine) and trained them using a labeled dataset of tweets categorized as positive or negative for depression.
   - Employed various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to enhance model performance.

### Depression Detection:
  - Used models to classify tweets as indicating depression or not.
  - Evaluated models performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results and Performance:
  - **Accuracy:** This project aims to achieve high accuracy in detecting depressive sentiments in tweets.
  - **Efficiency:** Use of efficient NLP techniques and models ensures quick and accurate sentiment analysis.
  - **Comparative Analysis:** Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved higher accuracy as compared to Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.
