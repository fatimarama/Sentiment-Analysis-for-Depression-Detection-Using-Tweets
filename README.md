# Project Description:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis to identify signs of depression in social media users based on their tweets. By using multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to detect depression-related sentiments.

## Key Components:
### 1. Data Source:
  - **Source:** Tweets dataset downnloaded from Kaggle.
  - **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing tweets to remove noise such as hashtags, links, and special characters.
    - **Groq:** Utilized for high-performance embedding generation.
    - **all-MiniLM-L6-v2:** A lightweight model for creating efficient and effective embeddings.
    - **Llama-3.1-70b-versatile:** Used for geenrating relevant responses.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Models:

  - **Model Selection:** Used four different models for sentiment analysis to compare results.
  - **Depression Detection:** Models specifically trained to identify depressive sentiments based on the text of the tweets.

## Workflow:
  ### 1. Data Preparation:
    - Collect tweets using the Twitter API based on specific keywords and hashtags related to depression.
    - Clean and preprocess the text data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

Model Training and Fine-tuning:

Utilize pre-trained sentiment analysis models and fine-tune them using a labeled dataset of tweets categorized as depressive or non-depressive.
Employ various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to enhance model performance.
Depression Detection:

Implement the sentiment analysis model to classify tweets as indicating depression or not.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Results and Performance:
Accuracy: The project aims to achieve high accuracy in detecting depressive sentiments in tweets.
Efficiency: Use of efficient NLP techniques and models ensures quick and accurate sentiment analysis.
Scalability: The system is designed to handle a large volume of tweets and can be scaled as needed.
